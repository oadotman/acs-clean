### **Test Suite 2: Cliché Filtering & Detection**

**Objective:** Verify banned clichés are blocked from generated copy

#### 2.1 Test Cliché Detection Function
```python
# Backend test
from app.constants.premium_copywriting_standards import detect_cliches

test_copy = "This is a game-changer product that will revolutionize your business. Don't miss out!"
violations = detect_cliches(test_copy)

# Expected violations: "game-changer", "revolutionize", "don't miss out"
assert len(violations) >= 3
assert any(v['phrase'] == 'game-changer' for v in violations)
```

#### 2.2 Quality Assessment Score
```python
from app.constants.premium_copywriting_standards import assess_copy_quality

# Bad copy
bad_copy = "Amazing! Incredible! This world-class solution is revolutionary. Don't miss out!!!"
quality = assess_copy_quality(bad_copy, "facebook", "improved")
assert quality['score'] < 60
assert quality['overall_verdict'].startswith('Poor')
assert len(quality['cliche_violations']) > 0

# Good copy
good_copy = "Finally—a strategic solution that delivers measurable results. Join our community of successful businesses."

assert improved_length <= standards['max']
```

#### 5.2 Hook Quality
```python
# First 5 words should be compelling
first_five = ' '.join(improved_copy.split()[:5])

# Should START with strong hook patterns:

    "imagine", "finally", "picture", "discover", "meet the",
    "here's how", "this is why", "because you", "ready to",
    "what if", "stop wasting", "tired of", "struggling with"

```python
# Should NOT contain robotic transitions
robotic_transitions = [
    "additionally", "furthermore", "moreover", "subsequently",
    "in addition to", "in conclusion"

for transition in robotic_transitions:
    assert transition not in improved_lower, f"Found robotic transition: {transition}"

emoji_check = validate_emoji_usage(instagram_copy, "instagram")
assert emoji_check['valid']

```python
# User says "exclude"
emoji_check = validate_emoji_usage(copy_with_emojis, "facebook", user_emoji_preference="exclude")
assert not emoji_check['valid'], "Should fail if user said no emojis but emojis present"

# User says "include"
emoji_check = validate_emoji_usage(copy_with_emojis, "facebook", user_emoji_preference="include")
assert emoji_check['valid'], "Should pass if user wants emojis and they're present"
