## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
# Copy/paste contents of: database/migrations/add_support_tickets_table.sql
# Click "Run"
```

### Step 2: Register Backend Router
Add to your main FastAPI file (e.g., `backend/main_launch_ready.py`):

```python
from app.routers import support

# Add this line where other routers are included:
app.include_router(support.router)
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables (if not already set)
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=support@adcopysurge.com
