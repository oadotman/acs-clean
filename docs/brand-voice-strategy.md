# 🎯 Brand Voice Data Collection Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for collecting and managing brand voice information in the AdCopySurge platform. The goal is to enable the Brand Voice Engine tool to provide accurate, personalized brand alignment analysis and recommendations.

## 🏗️ Current System Analysis

### Backend Implementation Status
- ✅ **Brand Voice Engine Tool**: Fully implemented with sophisticated analysis
- ✅ **API Schemas**: Complete brand guidelines structure defined  
- ✅ **Analysis Pipeline**: Ready to process brand voice data
- ❌ **Data Collection**: No systematic collection mechanism in place

### Database Schema Requirements

Based on the current database structure, we need to add brand voice tables:

```sql
-- Brand voice profiles table
CREATE TABLE brand_voice_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  profile_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  
  -- Tone characteristics
  primary_tone TEXT, -- professional, casual, authoritative, friendly, innovative
  secondary_tone TEXT,
  formality_level TEXT, -- formal, semi_formal, casual
  
  -- Personality traits
  personality_traits TEXT[], -- confident, trustworthy, innovative, empathetic, playful, ambitious
  
  -- Voice attributes
  voice_attributes JSONB, -- technical_complexity, emotional_expressiveness, humor_usage
  
  -- Brand lexicon
  preferred_words TEXT[],
  prohibited_words TEXT[],
  brand_specific_terms TEXT[],
  
  -- Sample content
  brand_samples TEXT[], -- 3-5 examples of approved brand content
  
  -- Messaging hierarchy
  messaging_hierarchy TEXT[], -- benefits, features, social_proof, etc.
  
  -- Brand values and context
  brand_values TEXT[],
  industry_context TEXT,
  target_audience_description TEXT,
  
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Constraints
  CONSTRAINT fk_brand_voice_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Project-specific brand voice overrides
CREATE TABLE project_brand_voice_overrides (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  brand_voice_profile_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES brand_voice_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  
  -- Override-specific adjustments
  tone_adjustments JSONB,
  vocabulary_additions TEXT[],
  context_specific_rules TEXT[],
  
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  UNIQUE(project_id, brand_voice_profile_id)
);

-- Brand voice analysis results (for learning and improvement)
CREATE TABLE brand_voice_analysis_results (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  analysis_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES ad_analyses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  brand_voice_profile_id UUID REFERENCES brand_voice_profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  
  -- Analysis scores
  tone_consistency_score INTEGER,
  vocabulary_alignment_score INTEGER,
  personality_consistency_score INTEGER,
  overall_brand_alignment_score INTEGER,
  
  -- Detailed results
  analysis_data JSONB, -- Full brand voice tool output
  
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 📊 Data Collection Strategy

### Phase 1: Registration & Onboarding (Minimal Viable)

**When**: During user registration or first analysis setup
**Goal**: Collect basic brand voice information to enable immediate analysis

#### Collection Points:
1. **Enhanced Registration Flow**
   - Company/brand name
   - Industry selection
   - Basic tone preference (dropdown: Professional, Casual, Friendly, Authoritative)
   - Target audience description (text field)

2. **First Analysis Setup** 
   - "Tell us about your brand tone" modal
   - Quick tone assessment (3-5 multiple choice questions)
   - Optional brand sample upload

#### Implementation:
```typescript
// Enhanced registration form
interface BasicBrandVoiceSetup {
  company_name: string;
  industry: string;
  primary_tone: 'professional' | 'casual' | 'friendly' | 'authoritative';
  target_audience: string;
  brand_samples?: string[]; // Optional 1-2 samples
}
```

### Phase 2: Progressive Enhancement (Comprehensive)

**When**: After user has completed a few analyses
**Goal**: Build detailed brand voice profile through guided setup

#### Collection Methods:

1. **Brand Voice Assessment Wizard**
   - Multi-step guided questionnaire
   - Tone selection with examples
   - Personality trait selection
   - Vocabulary preferences
   - Sample content upload/input

2. **Smart Suggestions Based on Analysis History**
   - Analyze user's previous ad copy for patterns
   - Suggest brand voice characteristics based on their writing style
   - Allow user to confirm or adjust suggestions

3. **Brand Sample Analyzer**
   - User pastes 3-5 examples of their existing content
   - AI analyzes and extracts brand voice characteristics
   - User reviews and confirms the analysis

#### Implementation Locations:

1. **Dedicated Brand Voice Settings Page** (`/settings/brand-voice`)
2. **Project Setup Integration** (optional brand voice profile selection)
3. **In-Analysis Prompts** (when brand voice analysis shows low confidence)

### Phase 3: Continuous Learning (Advanced)

**When**: Ongoing, as user continues using the platform
**Goal**: Refine and improve brand voice accuracy over time

#### Learning Mechanisms:

1. **User Feedback Integration**
   - After each brand voice analysis, ask: "Does this match your brand voice?" (Yes/No/Partially)
   - For "No" or "Partially", ask what was incorrect
   - Use feedback to adjust brand voice profile

2. **Content Analysis Mining**
   - Analyze all user's ad copy submissions for patterns
   - Identify consistent tone, vocabulary, and style elements
   - Suggest profile updates based on usage patterns

3. **A/B Testing Results Integration**
   - Track which brand-aligned variations perform better
   - Adjust brand voice recommendations based on performance data

## 🎨 User Interface Design

### Brand Voice Setup Wizard

```jsx
// Brand Voice Setup Wizard Component
const BrandVoiceWizard = () => {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState({});

  const steps = [
    { title: "Basic Info", component: BasicInfoStep },
    { title: "Tone & Style", component: ToneSelectionStep },
    { title: "Personality", component: PersonalityStep },
    { title: "Vocabulary", component: VocabularyStep },
    { title: "Brand Samples", component: SamplesStep },
    { title: "Review", component: ReviewStep }
  ];

  return (
    <WizardContainer>
      <StepIndicator steps={steps} currentStep={step} />
      <StepContent>
        {React.createElement(steps[step - 1].component, {
          profile,
          onUpdate: setProfile,
          onNext: () => setStep(s => s + 1),
          onPrev: () => setStep(s => s - 1)
        })}
      </StepContent>
    </WizardContainer>
  );
};
```

### Step Components

#### 1. Tone Selection Step
```jsx
const ToneSelectionStep = ({ profile, onUpdate }) => {
  const tones = [
    {
      id: 'professional',
      name: 'Professional',
      description: 'Formal, expertise-focused, industry-appropriate',
      example: 'Transform your business with innovative solutions that deliver proven results.'
    },
    {
      id: 'casual',
      name: 'Casual',
      description: 'Conversational, approachable, easy-going',
      example: 'Hey! Ready to make your business awesome? We've got just the thing.'
    },
    // ... more tones
  ];

  return (
    <ToneSelectionGrid>
      {tones.map(tone => (
        <ToneCard 
          key={tone.id}
          tone={tone}
          selected={profile.primary_tone === tone.id}
          onSelect={() => onUpdate({...profile, primary_tone: tone.id})}
        />
      ))}
    </ToneSelectionGrid>
  );
};
```

#### 2. Brand Samples Step
```jsx
const SamplesStep = ({ profile, onUpdate }) => {
  const [samples, setSamples] = useState(profile.brand_samples || ['']);

  return (
    <Box>
      <Typography variant="h6">Brand Content Examples</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary" sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        Paste 3-5 examples of your existing content (emails, website copy, social posts, etc.)
      </Typography>
      
      {samples.map((sample, index) => (
        <TextField
          key={index}
          fullWidth
          multiline
          rows={3}
          value={sample}
          onChange={(e) => {
            const newSamples = [...samples];
            newSamples[index] = e.target.value;
            setSamples(newSamples);
            onUpdate({...profile, brand_samples: newSamples});
          }}
          placeholder={`Brand sample ${index + 1}`}
          sx={{ mb: 2 }}
        />
      ))}
      
      <Button onClick={() => setSamples([...samples, ''])}>
        Add Another Sample
      </Button>
    </Box>
  );
};
```
