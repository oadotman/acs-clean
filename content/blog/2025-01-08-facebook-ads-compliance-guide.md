## Understanding Facebook's Ad Policies {#understanding-policies}

Facebook's advertising policies exist to create a safe and positive experience for users. They're designed to prevent misleading, offensive, or harmful content from appearing in users' feeds.

### The Three Pillars of Facebook Ad Policy

**1. Community Standards**
- No discrimination or hate speech
- Respect for intellectual property
- Safety and authenticity requirements

**2. Advertising Policies**  
- Prohibited content categories
- Restricted content guidelines
- Targeting and delivery standards

**3. Commerce Policies**
- Product and service standards
- Business integrity requirements
- Customer service expectations

## 2025 Policy Updates You Must Know {#policy-updates}

Facebook has made several significant policy changes in 2025 that every advertiser needs to understand:

### AI and Synthetic Media Disclosure

**New Requirement:** All ads containing AI-generated content must include clear disclosure.

**What This Means:**
- AI-generated images must be labeled
- Synthetic voices require disclosure
- Deepfake technology is strictly prohibited

**Best Practice:** Add a small disclosure text like "Image enhanced with AI" for AI-modified content.

### Health Claims Restrictions

**Updated Policy:** Even more stringent requirements for health-related claims.

**Key Changes:**
- No before/after images for weight loss products
- Stricter medical device advertising rules
- Enhanced scrutiny of supplement claims

### Political Ad Transparency

**New Requirements:**
- Enhanced verification for political advertisers
- Stricter "Paid for by" disclosures
- Expanded definition of political content

## Common Rejection Reasons and How to Avoid Them {#common-rejections}

Based on our analysis of 10,000+ ad rejections, here are the most common reasons and solutions:

### 1. Misleading Claims (34% of rejections)

**Common Issues:**
- Exaggerated results promises
- Unsubstantiated statistics
- Clickbait headlines

**Solutions:**
```
❌ "Lose 30 pounds in 30 days guaranteed!"
✅ "Join thousands who've transformed their health with our program"

❌ "Make $10,000 per month working from home"
✅ "Learn proven strategies for building a home-based business"
```

### 2. Personal Attributes Targeting (28% of rejections)

**The Problem:** Facebook prohibits targeting based on personal attributes like health conditions, financial status, or personal struggles.

**Avoid These Phrases:**
- "Struggling with debt?"
- "Suffering from depression?"
- "Going through a divorce?"

**Use Instead:**
- Focus on aspirations, not problems

- Images focusing on body parts
- Shocking or sensational imagery

**Image Best Practices:**
- Use original photography when possible
- Avoid close-ups of body parts
- Choose aspirational over problem-focused imagery
- Ensure all people in images appear happy and healthy

### 4. Landing Page Issues (16% of rejections)

**Facebook reviews your landing page too:**
- Broken links or errors
