  "data": {
    "score": 8.5,
    "platform": "facebook",
    "improvement": "+15%",
    "top_insights": [
      "Strong headline engagement",
      "Call-to-action needs improvement",
      "Visual appeal is excellent"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Full Format
Complete analysis including all insights, recommendations, scores breakdown, and metadata.

### Scores Only
Just the essential metrics: score, platform, and improvement percentage.

### Accessing Data in n8n

In your n8n nodes, access the data using expressions:
- `{{ $json.data.score }}` - Get the score
- `{{ $json.data.platform }}` - Get the platform
- `{{ $json.data.top_insights }}` - Get insights array
- `{{ $json.timestamp }}` - Get timestamp

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Webhook URL is invalid"
- Make sure you copied the complete URL from n8n
- URL should start with `https://` or `http://`
- No spaces before or after the URL
- Use the **Production URL**, not the Test URL

### "Test connection failed"
- Make sure your n8n workflow is **active** (executed/listening)
- Check if your n8n instance is accessible from the internet
- If self-hosted, verify firewall/port settings
- Test URL manually with a tool like Postman

### "No data appearing in n8n"
1. Verify your workflow is **active** (green dot in workflow list)
2. Click "Execute Workflow" to start listening
3. Check that the webhook URL in AdCopySurge matches n8n exactly
4. Run a test analysis in AdCopySurge
5. Check n8n "Executions" tab for any errors

### "Self-hosted n8n not receiving webhooks"
- **Port forwarding**: Make sure port 5678 (or custom) is accessible
- **Firewall**: Allow incoming connections to n8n
- **HTTPS**: Consider using ngrok or tunneling for testing
- **Public IP**: Your n8n instance needs to be reachable from internet

### "Workflow keeps timing out"
- Check "Response Mode" in webhook node (set to "On Received")
- Verify downstream nodes aren't taking too long
- Use "Execute Once" for testing instead of manual trigger

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use IF Nodes**: Add conditional logic to route high/low scores differently

2. **JavaScript Functions**: Process data with custom JavaScript code using Function nodes

3. **Error Handling**: Add "Error Trigger" nodes to catch and handle failures

4. **Credentials**: Store API keys securely in n8n's credentials system

5. **Variables**: Use workflow variables to store reusable values

6. **Execution History**: Check the "Executions" tab to see workflow runs and debug issues

7. **Copy Workflows**: Duplicate successful workflows for different use cases

8. **Version Control**: n8n supports Git integration for workflow backups

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Self-Hosted n8n:
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- ‚úÖ Set up webhook authentication (header auth or basic auth)
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Enable rate limiting on your server
- ‚úÖ Keep n8n updated to latest version

### For n8n Cloud:
- ‚úÖ Use strong passwords and 2FA
- ‚úÖ Regularly review active workflows
- ‚úÖ Audit webhook access logs
- ‚úÖ Limit permissions for team members

---

## üìö Advanced Features

### Custom Code Processing

Add a **Function** node after the webhook:

```javascript
// Access webhook data
const analysisData = $input.first().json;

// Process the data
if (analysisData.data.score < 6.0) {
  return {
    json: {
      alert: 'urgent',
      message: `Low score detected: ${analysisData.data.score}`,
      platform: analysisData.data.platform
    }
  };
}

// Return modified data
return { json: analysisData };
```

### Multiple Environment Support

Create separate workflows for:
- **Production** - Live analysis data
- **Development** - Test data
- **Staging** - QA validation

Each with different webhook URLs configured in AdCopySurge.
