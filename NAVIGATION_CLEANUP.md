# Navigation Cleanup - Removed Duplicate "Team" Link

## Issue
A standalone "Team" navigation item was appearing in the left sidebar navigation, separate from the Agency > Team Management submenu.

## Root Cause
The `navigation.js` constants file had an old standalone "Team" item defined in `MAIN_NAV_ITEMS` that pointed to `/team`. This was redundant with the proper "Team Management" under the Agency section at `/agency/team`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Standalone Team Nav Item
**File:** `frontend/src/constants/navigation.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
MAIN_NAV_ITEMS = [
  { id: 'new-analysis', ... },
  { id: 'dashboard', ... },
  { id: 'analyses', ... },
  { id: 'projects', ... },
  { id: 'team', label: 'Team', path: '/team', ... } // ❌ Removed
];
```

**After:**
```javascript
MAIN_NAV_ITEMS = [
  { id: 'new-analysis', ... },
  { id: 'dashboard', ... },
  { id: 'analyses', ... },
  { id: 'projects', ... }
  // Team management is now under Agency section (/agency/team)
];
```

### 2. Removed Old Path Constant
**File:** `frontend/src/constants/navigation.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
export const PATHS = {
  DASHBOARD: '/dashboard',
  NEW_ANALYSIS: '/analysis/new',
  ANALYSES: '/history',
  PROJECTS: '/projects',
  TEAM: '/team', // ❌ Removed
  ...
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
export const PATHS = {
  DASHBOARD: '/dashboard',
  NEW_ANALYSIS: '/analysis/new',
  ANALYSES: '/history',
  PROJECTS: '/projects',
  // Removed TEAM - use AGENCY_TEAM instead
  ...
};
```

### 3. Added Redirect for Old URL
**File:** `frontend/src/App.js`

Added a redirect route so anyone with bookmarks to the old `/team` URL will automatically be redirected to `/agency/team`:

```javascript
{/* Redirect old /team route to new /agency/team */}
<Route path="/team" element={<Navigate to="/agency/team" replace />} />
```

## Result

✅ **Before:** Navigation had TWO team links:
- "Team" in main navigation (pointing to `/team`)
- "Team Management" under Agency section (pointing to `/agency/team`)

✅ **After:** Navigation has ONE team link:
- "Team Management" under Agency > [AGENCY] section only (pointing to `/agency/team`)

## Navigation Structure (Final)

```
Navigation
├── My Projects (/projects)
└── Analysis History (/history)

ACCOUNT
├── Settings (/profile)
├── Billing & Credits (/billing)
└── [AGENCY] ⭐ (expandable)
    ├── 🤝 Integrations (/agency/integrations)
    ├── 👥 Team Management (/agency/team)  ← Only team link
    ├── 📊 Reports & Branding (/agency/reports)
    └── 🏷️ White Label Settings (/agency/white-label)
```

## Backward Compatibility

Users who had bookmarked or had links to the old `/team` URL will be automatically redirected to `/agency/team` with no 404 errors.

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/constants/navigation.js**
   - Removed `team` item from `MAIN_NAV_ITEMS` (line 52-59)
   - Removed `TEAM` from `PATHS` constant (line 188)

2. **frontend/src/App.js**
   - Added redirect route from `/team` to `/agency/team` (line 529)

## Testing

- ✅ "Team" no longer appears as standalone item in navigation
- ✅ "Team Management" still appears under Agency section
- ✅ Clicking "Team Management" goes to `/agency/team`
- ✅ Navigating to `/team` redirects to `/agency/team`
- ✅ Agency section expands/collapses correctly

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Issue:** Removed duplicate "Team" navigation item from left sidebar
